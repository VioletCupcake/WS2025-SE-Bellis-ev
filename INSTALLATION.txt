B-EV MVP CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - README & GUIDE
================================================

Hello and welcome to my new and improved document.
I chose docker because everything else seemed like a huge pain
(Especially setting up postgres and such)

PREREQUISITES:
- Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker + Docker Compose (Linux)
- 4GB RAM, 2GB disk space


INSTALLATION (3 STEPS):
-----------------------

1. Extract the zip file to any location

2. Open terminal in the extracted folder or navigate to it and run:

   docker compose up --build

   (First run takes 2-3 minutes to download and build
   The console output contains possible error codes as well as logins/URLS)


3. When you see "B-EV Case Management System READY", open browser and navigate to:

   http://localhost:8002/login/ for the main app
   http://localhost:8002/admin/ for the admin panel


4. Login with the account you want to test

For the main app MVP, the login data are visible on the login page.
Here is a seperate overview - only user_erweitert and user_admin have acccess to the admin panel

TEST ACCOUNTS (password: test123):
-----------------------------------
- user_basis      (basic permissions)
- user_erweitert  (extended permissions)
- user_admin      (full admin access)

TESTING OPTIONS:
Über "Neuer Fall" einen Fall anlegen
Im Fall "Neue Beratung", "Neuen Gewaltvorfall" und "Neue Folge der Gewalt" anlegen
Testing von Conditional displays, field validation, editing, Beratungs-Tracking, deletion

KNOWN LIMITS / ISSUES:
- New users can't currently be created
- Archived cases currently stay in the database only and cant be seen by admins
- newly created entries over the admin panel are probably database only 


STOPPING:
---------
Press Ctrl+C in terminal, then run:

docker compose down


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Port 8002 already in use?
  -> Edit docker-compose.yml, change "8002:8002" to "8003:8002"
     Then access at http://localhost:8003/login/

Database connection timeout?
  -> Run: docker compose down -v
     Then: docker compose up --build

Docker not running?
  -> Start Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or service (Linux)


FRESH START (deletes all data):
--------------------------------
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build


That's it. Questions? See README.md in the repo for details.
